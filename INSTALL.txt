*
* myChEMBL Version  18.0
*
* ChEMBL Release:   18
*
***************************************************************************

These instructions use the VirtualBox virtualisation software to install the 
myChEMBL virtual machine and describe the usage of a graphical user 
interface.

1.  If you do not already have VirtualBox installed on your computer, 
    please download and install this free software from the following site:
   
    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
   
2.  Download the .ovf, .vmdk amd .mf myChEMBL files into the same folder 
    on your computer. (Note the the .vmdk file is ~20GB in size)

3.  Open VirtualBox

4.  From VirtualBox main menu click on "File" > "Import Appliance..."

5.  An "Applicance to import" dialog will appear. Use the "Open appliance"
    button to navigate to the folder containing the myChEMBL .ovf file and
    open the .ovf file

6.  An "Appliance settings" dialog will appear. This will allow you to edit
    virtual machine import settings (e.g. number of CPUs, allocated RAM).
    Click "Import" button to start import process. This normally takes 20-
    30 minutes.

7.  Once the import completes a new virtual machine named myChEMBL-XX.X 
    should appear in the VirtualBox Manager menu list. To start up myChEMBL
    click on the myChEMBL virtual machine name.
   
8.  A VirtualBox terminal emulator will pop up providing you access to an
    Ubuntu linux shell. You will be prompted for a mychembl username and 
    password, these are:
   
    username: chembl
    password: chemblvm
    
    *The chembl user has been given sudo privileges*

    Note, when interacting with the VirtualBox terminal emulator you may 
    find it 'captures' your mouse cursor, preventing you from interacting
    with host operating system. The command to release the mouse cursor 
    (referred to as "host key" in VirtualBox documentation) is displayed 
    in bottom right-hand corner of terminal emulator (on Mac OSx it 
    defaults to left Command key and on Windows deafults to right Control
    key).

9.  Setting up a stable network connection between the host computer and 
    the myChEMBL virtual machine has sometimes proved tricky for some 
    myChEMBL users. Local network settings, dropped network connections and
    VPNs have all caused communication issues between the the host OS and 
    myChEMBL. For this reason we recommend the following approach for 
    connecting to myChEMBL when using VirtualBox:
    
    i.   Shutdown the myChEMBL VM
    
    ii.  Go to Virtual Box menu > Preferences > Network > Host-only Networks.
         - If there are no networks listed there, click the button "Add host-only network".
           "vboxnet0" will be added to the list.
         - Click OK
         - If there is already a network called "vboxnet0" there, click Cancel
    
    iii.  Select myChEMBL VM in the VirtualBox Manager window
    
    iv. Go to Settings > Network > Adapter 1 and update following settings
         - Check the "Enable Network Adapter" checkbox 
         - Switch the "Attached to:" dropdown menu to "NAT"

    v.  Go to Settings > Network > Adapter 2 and update following settings
         - Check the "Enable Network Adapter" checkbox 
         - Switch the "Attached to:" dropdown menu to "Host-only Adapter"
         - Switch the "Name" dropdown menu to "vboxnet0"
         
    vi.   Close the Setting window and now start up the myChEMBL VM
    
    vii.  Use a web browser to connect to myChEMBL LaunchPad page with the 
         following URL
    
          http://192.168.56.101/ 
    
          or try and ssh into the VM using the command line
    
          ssh chembl@192.168.56.101  (password chemblvm)

future myChEMBL updates. If you experience any problems or have any
