***************************************************************************

These instructions use the VirtualBox virtualisation software to install the 
myChEMBL virtual machine and describe the usage of a graphical user 
interface.

1.  If you do not already have VirtualBox installed on your computer, 
    please download and install this free software from the following site:
   
    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
   
2.  Download the .ovf, .vmdk amd .mf myChEMBL files into the same folder 
    on your computer. (Note the the .vmdk file is ~9GB in size)

3.  Open VirtualBox

4.  From VirtualBox main menu click on "File" > "Import Appliance..."

5.  An "Applicance to import" dialog will appear. Use the "Open appliance"
    button to navigate to the folder containing the myChEMBL .ovf file and
    open the .ovf file

6.  An "Appliance settings" dialog will appear. This will allow you to edit
    virtual machine import settings (e.g. number of CPUs, allocated RAM).
    Click "Import" button to start import process. This normally takes 20-
    30 minutes. Once the import completes a new virtual machine named 
    myChEMBL-XX.X should appear in the VirtualBox Manager menu list, hold
    off clicking on this until you have configured network settings.
    
7.  Setting up a stable network connection between the host computer and 
    the myChEMBL virtual machine has sometimes proved tricky for some 
    myChEMBL users. Local network settings, dropped network connections and
    VPNs have all caused communication issues between the the host OS and 
    myChEMBL. For this reason we recommend the following approach for 
    connecting to myChEMBL when using VirtualBox:
    
    i.   If running, shutdown the myChEMBL VM
    
    ii.  Go to Virtual Box menu > Preferences > Network > Host-only Networks.
         - If there is already a network called "vboxnet0" there, click Cancel
         - If there are no networks listed there, click the button "Add 
         host-only network" (look for a small '+' button), "vboxnet0" will be 
         added to the list.
         - Click OK
    
    iii.  Select myChEMBL VM in the VirtualBox Manager window
    
    iv. Go to Settings > Network > Adapter 1 and update following settings
         - Check the "Enable Network Adapter" checkbox 
         - Switch the "Attached to:" dropdown menu to "NAT"
         - Under the Advanced settings, check the 'Adapter Type' is not a 
           server version. The name should be similar to: 
           'Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop'. 


    v.  Go to Settings > Network > Adapter 2 and update following settings
         - Check the "Enable Network Adapter" checkbox 
         - Switch the "Attached to:" dropdown menu to "Host-only Adapter"
         - Switch the "Name" dropdown menu to "vboxnet0"
         
    vi.   Close the Setting window and now start up the myChEMBL VM

8.  Start up the virtual machine by clicking on the myChEMBL-XX.X name,
    which appears in the VirtualBox Manager menu list. A VirtualBox terminal
    emulator will appear, which you can ignore and minimise. 
    
9.  Use a web browser to connect to myChEMBL LaunchPad page with the 
    following URL:
    
    http://192.168.56.101/ 
    
10. If required, we recommend sshing into the VM and not using the 
    VirtualBox terminal emulator, as the mouse and clipboard are not 
    configured to work with host operating system when using 
    VirtualBox terminal emulator. To ssh into the myChEMBL virtual machine
    use the following command:
        
    ssh chembl@192.168.56.101 
    
    The linux username and password for the myChEMBL virtual machine are:
   
    username: chembl
    password: chemblvm
    
    *The chembl user has been given sudo privileges*

future myChEMBL updates. If you experience any problems or have any
